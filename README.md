# AI Image Processing and Classification Project

---

## AI Explanation

While I have minimal experience with Python, many of the AI's explanations for each line of code did make sense to me. This may be because I already have experience implementing image classification in Kotlin for my midterm app development project. For the image classification I implemented in that project, I used an API, and took similar steps in taking the image, resizing it, converting it to a bitmap (though in this instance, it is converting it into a NumPy array), and retrieving JSON data for best guesses for categories of food and parsing and using that data. In base_classifier.py, it seems that something similar may be happening based on the AI's explanation: the image array is fed to the model and then the predictions it gets are decoded and then displayed in the terminal.
If I had not already had previous experience implementing image classification, this would likely make way less sense to me than it does now. The only things that don't entirely make sense to me yet are the functions and syntax used. However, these are things I can pick up on quickly, and already being familiar with implementing image classification places me ahead of the game, I believe.
